# JavaScript-Fundamentals-by-Building-a-Gradebook-App
This was a small little project from freeCodeCamp where I built a little grade book calculator.

The function getAverage takes the score array and calulates the average of all the inputs.

The function getGrade will take the score array and calculate the letter grade based of of the scores using an if eles if statement.

The studentMsg function allows the teacher to send a messeage to their students with their grade results depending on if they passed the class.
